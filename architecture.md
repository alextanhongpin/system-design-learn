## How would you describe your existing application architecture? 

- we adopt the n-tier architecture
- also called multi-tier architecture because the software is engineered to have the processing, data management and presentation functions physically and logically separated.
- logic tier, presentation tier and data tier
- we run server side rendering using NextJS as our presentation tier for web, and React native for desktop. They contain mostly dumb logics - which means they are mainly representing views
- for the logic tier, our backend is running an upgraded rails version
- for the data tier, we invested in postgres

How would you design a marketing banner platform?
- Campaign platform
- Leaderboard platform
